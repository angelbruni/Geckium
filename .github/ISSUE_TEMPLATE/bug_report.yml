        > If you're reporting a design inaccuracy, MAKE SURE the Chromium or Google Chrome you're comparing against matches the version in Geckium's About dialog/page - multiple issues have been reported where Google changed the design before or since the version of Chromium that the selected Geckium era represents, and can waste triagers' time.
